I can not even begin to explain just how fast this first week has flown by.   I'm already five days and 20+ hours of coding into the First Mile and the things I have learned and found are astounding...
​
First,  the people are great.  I started this program to shift into a new career field, but I know that I will have the staying power to succeed in this cohort due to the amazing and supporting people who I am lucky enough to accompany on this journey.  Seriously, they are incredible.  I am a HUGE fan of community and collaboration, which seems to fit right in with the values of the industry.  How perfect is that??
​
Secondly, the first couple of baby steps into this program during the first week have already shown me how applicable these skills that we're building will be.  Learning about methods and then equating them to "machines that can work inside of our code" or seeing my first loop run on FOREVER and break my code have been scary and encouraging endeavors. Knowing myself, I hate the prospect of failing something.  It gets to the point that I typically would not attempt something that I had not explicitly detailed and planned out to the point of eliminating all possibility of failure or flaw...   With coding, I absolutely had to throw those behaviors out the window, because failure is the name of the game and success is fleeting and often misunderstood.  Simply put, I've never been more happy to suck at something.
​
Lastly, this program has me thinking.  Not only to work through each lesson or lab, but it really has me asking myself where I see this path taking me.  It took a while to figure out, but the answer I have come up with is this.   
​
I want to find obstacles that people face every day and help to solve them.  I had often found myself confronted with a problem that was regularly occuring and having no way to remedy it.  Enter The Flatiron School.  Using my nature of trying to "plan myself out of failing", before entering the program, I searched for stories of people who had successfully completed this program and the different ways they supported themselves, and one caught my eye.  
​
One graduate had started to share their experience via social media.  This allowed people she knew to become aware that she, who had not previously been associated with programming, was now learning skills to become a software engineer.  I have started to do the same thing.  This program has motivated me to reach out to the people on social media in an attempt to build a community of my own.  It is my hope that, through this, I will be able to find new and exciting things to bring to the lives of others!!nter your title here
